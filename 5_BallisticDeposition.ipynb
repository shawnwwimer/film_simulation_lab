    "Depending on your random number generator, you may see that the first and last columns don't reflect the more interior positions well. This can be due to boundary effects, some of which can be mitigated by periodic boundary conditions (PBCs). While a number of potential conditions exist, usually the condition $x+L \\to x$ is used. The growth direction does not have PBCs imposed (the source is very far away compared to the area of interest), so 2D simulations are sometimes called (1+1)D simulations to reflect that only one direction has a PBC. Similarly, 3D simulations are sometimes called (2+1)D simulations.\n",
