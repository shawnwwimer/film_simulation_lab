    "# Basic Python\n",
    "We're using Jupyter Notebook for this lab. Jupyter makes it easy to visualize and run the code in separate parts. A notebook is separated into individual cells with the input code and the output from running a cell is put immediately after that cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables\n",
    "Variables can represent virtually anything in Python; we'll use them mostly for values. Variable names must start with a letter and can contain numerals and underscores ( \\_ ). Generally their names should be a description of what they are for. Here are some examples of correct and incorrect variable names\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>L = 256     # fine\n",
    "L1 = 256    # fine\n",
    "L_ = 256    # fine\n",
    "1L = 256    # wrong\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comments\n",
    "Everything following '#' in a line is a comment. They have no effect on the operation of the code and are used to describe how it works and why things work. You should use them liberally. Comments can also be made by enclosing text in triple quotes, like:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code> ''' This is another comment '''\n",
    "''' \n",
    "    Comments like this can be separated \n",
    "    over multiple lines \n",
    "'''\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Number types\n",
    "We will deal with two types of numbers: integers and floats. Integers represent integers while floats represent numbers that can have decimal components. It is unlikely to matter in most cases and in Python you don't need to specify type.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical operators\n",
    "Basic operators are as follows\n",
    "* $x+y$: <code>x + y</code>\n",
    "* $x-y$: <code>x - y</code>\n",
    "* $\\frac{x}{y}$: <code>x / y</code>\n",
    "* $x^y$: <code>x**y</code>\n",
    "* $x \\mod y$: <code>x % y</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, the result of the modulo operation is restricted to the sign of $y$ and shouldn't be used for floats. Instead, you'd use a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions\n",
    "Functions are named similarly to variables and represent processes. Sometimes they take arguments, sometimes they don't. Sometimes they 'return' value(s) for further use, sometimes they don't. Sometimes they have side-effects, sometimes they don't. A simple function used often is <code>print()</code>, which is usually used with one argument. Using some variables, operators, and functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>x = 2\n",
    "y = x**2\n",
    "z = y * 2 / 3\n",
    "print(z)\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "$z$ will now have the value 2.6666666666666665 and <code>print(z)</code> will print it in the cell's output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strings\n",
    "Strings are ordered collections of characters and can also be stored in a variable. They are declared by enclosing the collection with single quotes or double quotes (but not both!) like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>s = 'string'   # fine\n",
    "s = \"string\"   # fine\n",
    "s = 'string\"   # wrong\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "If you want to include a backslash (\\), you need to 'escape' it by using another backslash:\n",
    "<code>s = '\\\\'</code>\n",
    "When we use Matplotlib we have access to certain LaTeX commands, like '\\theta' or '\\cos' that will also need to be escaped.\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful kind of string, particularly for printing out results, is the f-string. The f-string makes for easy formatting of a string with variables or operations. For example,\n",
    "<code>x = 2\n",
    "print(f'The square of {x} is {x**2}.')\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "This will print the line:\n",
    "The square of 2 is 4.\n",
    "Now we can change the value of $x$ and the print statement will be changed accordingly. Note that the 'f' comes before the string and the values are enclosed in curly brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Try running the cell below to see how Python and Jupyter work."

    "# More basic Python\n",
    "## Lists\n",
    "Lists are collections of objects, which can include strings and numbers. Lists are declared simply by enclosing comma-separated objects within square brackets, like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>L = [0, 1, 2]</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is appended to a list like so: <code>L.append(3)</code>. Items in the list are zero-indexed, so <code>L[0]</code> is the first item and <code>L[n]</code> is the $n-1$ item. A neat feature in Python is that the items can be accessed from the end with negative numbers, so if <code>L</code> is $N$ items long, then <code>L[-1]</code> will get the $N-1$ item (which is also the last) and <code>L[x]</code> will get the $N-x$ item, which is $x-1$ from the end. You can't get items outside the bounds of the list; an error will occur and the execution will stop. The length of the list can be gotten from a function: <code>len(L)</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists can be sliced, which returns a new list of selected elements from the original. For instance <code>L[1:4]</code> will return a list with the second through fourth elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tuples\n",
    "Tuples are similar to lists in that they are collections of objects. Tuples are declared similarly by enclosing comma-separated objects within parentheses, like so:\n",
    "<code>T = (0, 1, 2)</code>\n",
    "The primary difference between lists and tuples is that tuples cannot be changed after they are created (they are 'immutable').\n",
    "\n",
    "## Control statements\n",
    "Control statements are used to control the order of code execution. There are three common control-flow statements,\n",
    "* <code>if</code> \\[condition\\]<code>:</code>\n",
    "* <code>while</code> \\[condition\\]<code>:</code>\n",
    "* <code>for</code> \\[item\\] <code>in</code> \\[collection\\]<code>:</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "An if-statment checks if a condition is true or false; only if it is true will the code inside execute. A while-statement checks the condition, then runs the code if it's true, and repeats this process until the condition is false. A for-statement executes once for each item in the collection and helpfully exposes the item.\n",
    "\n",
    "White-space at the beginning of the line is important because Python uses it to group lines in control statements. You need it to be consistent; most code editors will do it automatically but you'll want to be careful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check some examples below."

    "# Basic NumPy\n",
    "Numpy is a commonly used module for making computations easier, particular with matrices or other collections of numbers. It offers many built-in mathematical operations and a useful interface for random numbers. Like other modules, the module is included in code with an <code>import</code> statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>import numpy as np</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Arrays\n",
    "We'll need to use arrays to represent film heights or other quantities. While arrays can be specified explicitly, some useful array-creation functions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* <code>np.zeros(shape)</code>: array of dimensions $shape$ filled with 0\n",
    "* <code>np.ones(shape)</code>: array of dimensions $shape$ filled with 1\n",
    "* <code>np.linspace(start, stop, number)</code>: $num$ evenly-spaced numbers between start and stop\n",
    "* <code>np.arange(start, stop, step)</code>: samples spaced $step$ from each other between start and stop\n",
    "\n",
    "The $shape$ is the dimensions of the array, so if <code>shape = (1,2,3)</code> then the array is $1\\times2\\times3$. The values in $shape$ have to be integers, floats will throw errors. There are many things one can do with the shape of an array but they won't be necessary in this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "You access elements in arrays like lists, similarly zero-indexed. <code>A[1,2]</code> returns the item in the second row and third column. You can access 'views' of the list by slicing: <code>A[:,2]</code> gets all rows in the third column.\n",
    "\n",
    "A mathematical function is applied elementwise to the entire array and returns a new array, so either the sizes need to match or one needs to be a single value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Random numbers\n",
    "NumPy has comprehensive random number generators but the process can be a little confusing at first. <code>numpy.random</code> is the submodule that contains what we'll need. The first step is to create a random number generator. A generator can be given a specific seed if a consistent sequence is desired, which will be useful for comparing similar methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the generator is created it can be sampled according to one of the many distribution functions NumPy offers. The sampling can occur one at a time or for entire arrays if a shape is passed to the function. Check the examples below to see the process."
